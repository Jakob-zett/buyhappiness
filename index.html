    		<h2 class="headline"> Step 1: The idea </h2> 
    		<p class="headcontent" >  Every year on black friday the profit of retailers around the world peak. Their numbers are “in the black”.
    			And like that black friday, over the years, became a day about the money. Good deals for consumers and high profits for retailers. <br>
    			In 2014 this meant $3,3 billion spent at the 100 biggest retailers alone. We spent an average of $290. <br>
    			At its core it is a day on which we give money to those who already have enough and in return mostly get stuff we do not really need. 
    			And a good deal may get us excited for a day or two but it does not make us truly happy. <br>
            
    			But we can turn this idea around once more. We can turn a day about profit into a day about happiness. <br>
    			We can turn black friday into happy friday. <br>
    		</p>
    		<h2 class="headline"> Step 2: The concept </h2>
    		<p class=headcontent>
    			That is why we assembled a few non-profits for you right here. And you can select your cause and help those in need, creating lasting happiness for both parties.<br> <br>
    		</p>
    		<h2 class="headline"> Step 3:The <span id="larger"> (larger) </span> concept</h2>
    		<p class="headcontent"> This website is only a small operation. However, there are plenty of big retailers out there reaching millions of people on black friday. We could to get them to implement a happyfriday-category, a category for the good cause, on their website and start celebrating happy friday around the world. <br> <br>
